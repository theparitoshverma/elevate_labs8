Created a sample dataset with fields like Order Date, Region, Category, Sales, and Profit.
A new column MonthYear was derived from Order Date for monthly trend analysis.
Done visualizations using matplotlib:
    Line Chart: Showed total sales over months using aggregated monthly data.
    Bar Chart: Displayed total sales per region.
    Donut Chart: Visualized total sales by product category.
Wrote key observations to a text file summarizing regional and category-wise performance and peak sales month.
Saved all charts and insights as downloadable files.
